# What is it? #
An implementation of the API for the photosharing service Zooomr (http://www.zooomr.com), this particular implementation is in PHP

# What do I need to use it? #

## An API KEY!! ##
API keys can be created in your Zooomr account settings: http://www.zooomr.com/account/external_services/api/

Please use the API documentation which can be found here: http://trac.zooomr.com/trac/wiki/ZooomrAPI

# Got any help with using this thing??! #
Yes! Use the Zooomr\_test.php file for your reference, this file exercises all API calls currently availble - though not all options on those calls.

# The Future! #
There are more API functions to come from Zooomr so check back soon for more exciting goodies :)

# **IMPORTANT** #
**This is PHP5 compliant and currently untested on PHP4**

I'm not saying it won't work, I'm just saying I haven't tried it - though I wouldn't expect it to work.

I will test it and fix it - honest - I actually need to make this work in order to update the [Zooomr Facebook App](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6037801363) WHICH YOU SHOULD BECOME A FAN OF RIGHT FREAKING NOW!!
